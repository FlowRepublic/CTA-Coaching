# Cheatsheet CTA Mock Scenarios

This cheat sheet is intended to give you guidance on common mistakes, considerations, and things to
cover in different parts of your solution and presentation. It consists of two parts, PT 1 is more general
while PT 2 focuses on specific aspects such as Data Model and System Landscape.
How to use it? In the beginning, use it to get a better feeling for the thoughts and considerations. Later
on, once you are more fluid, simply use it as a checklist one reviewing solutions and presentations. It is
an addition to your playbook, not a replacement for it.

In general
● No lengthy anything; as few as possible as long as necessary during Deck, Annotations,
Presentation & QA.
● Bullet points are good enough.
● Use Excel to calculate volumes.
● Double-check. Triple check your data volumes.
● Standardize your formats for deck, diagrams, and notes. Recreate from scratch every time in
the first minutes.
● Solving the scenario on the first read does not work, there are too many dependencies.
● Be comfortable with not knowing everything immediately.
● Mistakes are going to happen, what matters is how you deal with them.
Paper Notes
● Offload things from your brain. Put important information down on paper.
● Have a strategy for taking notes taking. 1 page each for actors & licenses, systems, integrations,
data
● Scribble diagrams and logical connections - Visuzalising helps you think clearer.
